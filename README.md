# Passion in Action | Scrape Project

> ðŸ”¥**DISCLAIMER**ðŸ”¥  
> This is a simple project for personal learning about web development, so this is not have been done for a real use.  
> In particular, NextJS and AWS (S3, Lambda and CloudWatch)

The project consists of scraping data from the original website (passion in action Polimi) using a Lambda function hosted on AWS and then putting those data into an S3 bucket.

The Lambda function is triggered periodically from CloudWatch.

The reasons behind not requesting on-demand data from the official website are:

1. Do not overload the source website
2. The data is not changing so fast, at most 1 times per week
3. Requesting data takes a lot of time, about 5 seconds because I'm also scraping the first grade nested data

### Features

In this website you are able to perform more different filter than the original one, thanks of the first grade nested data scraped, such as:

- by teachers
- by target courses
- by courses' duration months
